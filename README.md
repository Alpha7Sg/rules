#### for real time analytics
---
durable_rules is a polyglot micro-framework for real-time, consistent and scalable coordination of events. With durable_rules you can track and analyze information about things that happen (events) by combining data from multiple sources to infer more complicated circumstances.

A full forward chaining implementation (A.K.A. Rete) is used to evaluate facts and massive streams of events in real time. A simple, yet powerful meta-liguistic abstraction lets you define simple and complex rulesets, such as flowcharts, statecharts, nested statecharts and time driven flows. 

The Durable Rules core engine is implemented in C, which enables ultra fast rule evaluation and inference as well as muti-language support. Durable Rules relies on state of the art technologies: [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org), [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) are used to host rulesets written in JavaScript, Python and Ruby respectively. Inference state is cached using [Redis](http://www.redis.io). This allows for fault tolerant execution and scale-out without giving up performance.

### Example 1  

durable_rules is simple. Using your scripting language of choice, you only need to describe the event or fact pattern to match (antecedent) and the action to take (consequent).  

In this example the rule can be triggered by posting `{"id": 1, "subject": "World"}` to url `http://localhost:5000/test/1`.  

### Ruby
```ruby
require "durable"
Durable.ruleset :test do
  # antecedent
  when_all (m.subject == "World") do
    # consequent
    puts "Hello #{m.subject}"
  end
end
Durable.run_all
```  
### Python
```python
from durable.lang import *

with ruleset('test'):
    # antecedent
    @when_all(m.subject == 'World')
    def say_hello(c):
        # consequent
        print ('Hello {0}'.format(c.m.subject))

run_all()
```  
### JavaScript
```javascript
var d = require('durable');

with (d.ruleset('test')) {
    // antecedent
    whenAll(m.subject.eq('World'), function (c) {
        // consequent
        console.log('Hello ' + c.m.subject);
    });
} 
d.runAll();
```

### Example 2  

Letâ€™s consider a couple of fictitious fraud rules used in bank account management.  
Note: I'm paraphrasing the example presented in this [article](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/drools-jboss-rules-50complex-event-processing).  

1. If there are two debit requests greater than 200% the average monthly withdrawal amount in a span of 2 minutes, flag the account as medium risk.
2. If there are three consecutive increasing debit requests, withdrawing more than 70% the average monthly balance in a span of three minutes, flag the account as high risk.


### Ruby
```ruby
require "durable"

Durable.ruleset :fraud_detection do
  # compute monthly averages
  when_all span(86400), (m.t == "debit_cleared") | (m.t == "credit_cleared") do
    debit_total = 0
    credit_total = 0
    for tx in m do
      if tx.t == "debit_cleared"
        debit_total += tx.amount
      else
        credit_total += tx.amount
      end
    end

    s.balance = s.balance - debit_total + credit_total
    s.avg_balance = (s.avg_balance * 29 + s.balance) / 30
    s.avg_withdraw = (s.avg_withdraw * 29 + debit_total) / 30
  end

  # medium risk rule
  when_all c.first = (m.t == "debit_request") & 
                     (m.amount > s.avg_withdraw * 2),
           c.second = (m.t == "debit_request") & 
                      (m.amount > s.avg_withdraw * 2) & 
                      (m.stamp > first.stamp) &
                      (m.stamp < first.stamp + 120) do
    puts "Medium risk"
  end

  # high risk rule
  when_all c.first = m.t == "debit_request",
           c.second = (m.t == "debit_request") &
                      (m.amount > first.amount) & 
                      (m.stamp < first.stamp + 180),
           c.third = (m.t == "debit_request") & 
                     (m.amount > second.amount) & 
                     (m.stamp < first.stamp + 180),
           s.avg_balance < (first.amount + second.amount + third.amount) / 0.7 do
    puts "High risk"
  end
end

Durable.run_all

### Example 3  

durable_rules can also be used to solve traditional production bussiness rules problems. This example is the 'Miss Manners' industry benchmark. Miss Manners has decided to throw a party. She wants to seat her guests such that adjacent people are of opposite sex and share at least one hobby. 

Note how the benchmark flow structure is defined using a statechart to improve code readability without sacrificing performance. The benchmark results are competitive with other business rules systems both from an execution time as well as memory utilization perspective.
